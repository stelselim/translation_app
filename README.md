## Domain-Driven Design
Domain-driven design is a concept in order structure software projects and maintain the domain layer of the source code by [Eric Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericevansddd/). For further reading, [here](https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/). DDD is robust, solid & be applicable to various fields of software development. Thanks to DDD, massive projects are much maintainable with its principles. 

<br/>

## Flutter with DDD
In Flutter development, DDD might be used with different state management libraries; such as BLOC, provider, redux... This project uses BLOC. The directory of the project is mainly seperated into 4 subdirectories: Application, Domain, Presentation, Infrastructure. Each subdirectory has a valuable role in DDD. Every one of them should be considered as a layer of a building. Some layers contact other layers, some do not.

## CI/CD For Flutter
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery is an one of the most essential topics of software development. For mobile development, it strongly depends on SDKs and platforms both iOS & Android. This project uses Codemagic CI/CD configuration without any addition to source code. For further reading, [here](https://blog.codemagic.io/flutter-step-by-step-tutorial/).

Multi Translator App supports deep links for both iOS and Android. Deep links are useful when navigating the app from outside of it. This app takes two different parameters by deep link for translating. Also, Flutter supports universal links as well.
